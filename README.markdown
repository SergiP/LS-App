LS App - LoadSensing App
========================

Information
-----------

This project has been developed as a final project of the Master's Degree of Free Software of [UOC](http://www.uoc.edu/).

LS App is an application that allows remote access to real time and historic information of structure monitoring of LoadSensing application, information obtained of nodes that are distributed in various areas generating networks.

The development has been done in collaboration with [WorldSensing](http://www.worldsensing.com/) enterprise, that is involved in the development of communication systems and provides services related with sensor networks.
